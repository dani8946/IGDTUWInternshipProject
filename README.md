## 🎯 Overview

**AR in Education** is an interactive mobile application developed using Unity 3D and Vuforia Engine, aimed at revolutionizing primary education in rural areas. The app uses image recognition to project a rotating 3D model when a target image is scanned, accompanied by a brief descriptive narration. This immersive learning experience is designed to enhance student engagement, promote curiosity, and make learning both educational and enjoyable.

## 🌟 Features

- 📸 Camera-enabled image recognition
- 🌀 Real-time 360° 3D model animation
- 📝 Educational content alongside models
- 👦 Designed for rural primary school students
- 💰 Cost-efficient solution for scalable deployment

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Unity 3D**
- **Vuforia Engine**
- **Android SDK**
- **C# for scripting**
